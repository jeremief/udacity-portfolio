## 1. Description
This portfolio project is an assignment for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.
It is build using Bootstrap.

I also used Grunt to create several version of the same images but decided to not include it in here.

Its purpose is to illustrate the concept of responsive websites.


## 2. How to install
To obtain the files in this directory, you can either fork the repository in your own directory or download a zip file to your own machine and extract it. Either way, you should have the unzipped folder on your machine to be able to run it.


Your folder should contain two files and  folder called "Static".

1. index.html: the html code of the age
2. README.md: a copy of this document

The "Static" folder contains three sub-folders: images, that holds all the pictures used for the site,  "bootstrap", that contains a config file and two sub-olders all the scripts and css files used in the application and finally, "additional-css", which contains any additional css resources, like styles.css

## 3. How to get started 
Open index.html in your browser.
